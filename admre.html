					<h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer. He is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time, and his laws of motion and universal gravitation laid the foundation for modern physics.</p>

					<h2 class="section-title">Early Life and Education</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">Isaac Newton was born on December 25, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, England. His father died before he was born, and his mother remarried when he was three years old. Newton was raised by his grandmother until he was ten years old, when his mother returned with three children from her second marriage. Newton attended Cambridge University, where he studied mathematics and science.</p>

					<h2 class="section-title">Scientific Discoveries</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">Newton made many important scientific discoveries throughout his career. In 1687, he published his landmark work, "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), which laid out his laws of motion and universal gravitation. He also developed calculus independently of Gottfried Leibniz, although the two men became embroiled in a bitter dispute over who deserved credit for the discovery.</p>

					<h2 class="section-title">1665–67</h2>
					<p>Newton receives his bachelor’s degree in 1665, but the mathematical and scientific studies he has undertaken during his undergraduate years are still unknown to the world. The plague descends upon Europe, and Newton has to spend most of the next two years at home, developing the work that he had started at university. In 1667 Newton is elected to a fellowship at Trinity College after the university reopens after the plague years.</p>

					<p class="text-justify">Newton's contributions to science have had a profound impact on our understanding of the natural world. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and was the first scientist to be knighted for his work. In 1689, he was
